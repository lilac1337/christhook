v92 cheat, won't work with the current x64 build.  this was made to get around [rumour's](https://github.com/rumourA) optibricker concept, which i tested on [nairda's](https://github.com/Nairdaa) implementation of it.
if you wish to use this to cheat you will have to do a decent amount of work to update it, or make your own cheat using the same method i did here.

s/o d3x, toast, and [alkatraz](https://github.com/alkatrazbhop) for help and reference material.
